To configure Git access for the deploy user, you'll need to set up SSH key-based authentication with a Git service provider, such as GitHub or GitLab. Here's an example of how you can include the steps to configure Git access:

### Configuring Git Access for the Deploy User

To configure Git access for the deploy user, follow the steps below:

1. Log in to the virtual machine using the deploy user account:
   ```bash
   ssh deploy@your_server_ip
   ```

2. Generate an SSH key pair for the deploy user on the VM:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen
   ```

   This will create a public key (`id_rsa.pub`) and a private key (`id_rsa`) in the `~/.ssh` directory of the deploy user.

3. Copy the content of the public key (`id_rsa.pub`) by running the following command:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

   Copy the output of this command.

4. Log in to your Git service provider (e.g., GitHub or GitLab) and navigate to your account settings.

5. Add the deploy user's public key to your Git service provider account by following the instructions provided by the platform. Typically, you'll need to go to your account's SSH key settings and add a new SSH key. Paste the content of the public key (`id_rsa.pub`) that you copied earlier.

6. Test the Git access by running the following command:
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

   Replace `github.com` with the hostname of your Git service provider. You should see a success message indicating that authentication was successful.

7. Configure Git to use the deploy user's information:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

   Replace `"Your Name"` and `"your.email@example.com"` with the appropriate values for the deploy user.

After completing these steps, the deploy user will have SSH key-based authentication configured for Git access. You can now clone repositories, push changes, and perform other Git operations using the deploy user account on the VM.
